So maybe you have heard the following buzzwords,
but really do not understand what they mean,
what they are about,
and how they fit together:

- Cloud Native
- Twelve Factor
- Containers, Container Orchestration

If that is you,
this workshop is for you.

You will be introduced the the reasons and basic concepts you will need
to understand to successfully
*build, deploy and operate* an application on a modern *orchestrated*
platform.

Along the way you will build and deploy a basic web application to a
modern container orchestrated platform.

## Learning outcomes

After completing the workshop,
you will be able to:

-   Deploy a blocking web application to a modern orchestrated platform.

-   Explain the benefits of adopting cloud native principles and
    practices.

-   Explain some of the challenges of deploying applications in a
    cloud native architecture
